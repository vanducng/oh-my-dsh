### Mention files and sessions

Type `@` followed by part of a project path or session title. The popup lists workspace files first, then other sessions; use the arrow keys to move and `Tab` to insert the selected row. File picks insert a path through Harness file-reference discovery; they do not upload file contents. Session picks insert a mention that omdsh later replaces with a read-only snapshot of that session for the model.

Mentions stay highlighted in your message. File mentions give the agent an explicit path that it can inspect with its normal tools; they do not upload file contents. Session mentions do not resume or fork the source session.

```text
Compare @packages/tui/omdsh-tui/src/chrome/renderer.ts with @packages/tui/omdsh-tui/src/chrome/renderer.spec.ts and explain the missing edge case before editing.
```

`./` and `~/` also open path completion. The completion inserts a path; it does not bypass tool permissions or silently upload file contents.

### Add screenshots and images

Copy an image and press `Ctrl+V`. When the platform clipboard reader is available, the composer inserts a compact image marker instead of a temporary path; submit it with any explanatory text as one message, or send it with `/goal` or `/plan`. Pasting an image file path also imports that image when it can be read. Default DeepSeek catalog models stay text-only; a deployment that wants native image requests must list `inputModalities: [text, image]` on that model.

On Linux, native image paste uses `wl-paste` under Wayland or `xclip` under X11. If neither command is available, text paste continues to work but direct clipboard-image capture is unavailable. Images are checked against the Harness admission limits as they are pasted — 3.5 MiB and 2000px per side by default; a refused image shows an error notice and stays out of the prompt.

### Write structured prompts

Use `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`, or `Ctrl+J` for a newline. For a longer request, press `Ctrl+G` to edit the current draft in `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`, then return it to the composer.

```text
Goal: remove the duplicate loading row.

Constraints:
- keep the composer anchored
- preserve CJK display width
- add a regression test

Verification: run the focused TUI test and typecheck.
```
